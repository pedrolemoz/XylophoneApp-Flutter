## What I learned with this project?

This is where things start to get interesting. I learned how to use functions to build widgets, instead of repeat the same code many times.

I also learned how to work with an external library, in this case, [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers).

It was fun, and my girlfriend's niece loved!
